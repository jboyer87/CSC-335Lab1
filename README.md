# CSC-335 Lab 1

## Synopsis
The first lab covers several C++ data structures and algorithms exercises, outlined below. 

## Project 1.1:
A common punishment for school children is to write out the same sentence multiple times. Write a C++ stand - alone program that will write out the following sentence one hundred times : "I will always use object oriented design." Your program should number each of the sentences and it should "accidentally" make eight different random- looking typos at various points in the listing, so that it looks like a human typed it all by hand.
